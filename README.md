# Demo For Multilevel Queue CPU Scheduling Simulator 
## In this project implement how Multilevel Queue CPU Scheduling works when the CPU schedule chooses which CPU scheduling method to use based on the priority(High, Medium, Low).
### The methods that I used to represent the multilevel queue CPU scheduling are,
- for high-priority FCFS(First Come First Serve)
- for medium-priority SJF(Shortest Job First)
- for low-priority RR(Round Robin)
### The tech stack that used for this project
- programming language Java
- MVC design pattern for code structure
- project build with Netbeans
